Overview of the Files
---------------------
*opt-Read_Temp_Multiple.py* is used to record temps from any amount of thermometers to *temp_data_multiple.csv*

*Graph_Temperature_Multiple.py* is used to generate graphs of every individual **Temp x** vs. **Time** along with all temperatures combined.

*Read_Temp_Multiply.py* is the same as *opt-...* **but really inefficient and poorly-designed**. \[Although it technically works, it can crash if it fails to receive data. The only reason I haven't deleted it is because I caught pneumonia right after writing the optimized script and just forgot. I promise I'll be back in the lab this week now that I have the strength to be.\]

*Realtime_Read_Graph.py* is not finished. It is my current attempt at graphing temperature measurements in real time.
